# TDK-project
3D visualization and simulation program for proteins, check paper link

TDK-generator is just for generating data of simulations into .dat files
TDK-project-prev is a previous approach to searching for molecular structures
TDK-tester is for testing molecular structures with arbitrary fields

The branch GA-all-big-structures is the newest version of the project:
  It uses a genetic algorithm to look for molecular structures and fields
