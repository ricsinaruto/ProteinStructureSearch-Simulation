# Annealing+old-algorithm
##### This variant of the program uses the simulated annealing method to search for field values, combined with the searching algorithm in the Early-searching-algorithm branch to automatically search for protein structures at the same time. This means that it will try to find a protein structure configuration suitable for the defined logic function automatically without any other specification. It doesn't support manual protein structure creation and simulation. You can run the searching algorithm by pressing the 'f' key. Otherwise check the user guide in section 3.7 of the [paper](https://ricsinaruto.github.io/website/docs/tdk.pdf), and you can find instructions on how to enter a logic function in section 3.5.2.
