# GA-all-big-structures
##### In this variant of the program I implemented a genetic algorithm to find a protein structure as well as field values that satisfy a user defined logic function simultanously. This means that only the logic function has to be defined, other than that the algorithm will efficiently look for suitable protein structure configurations, and if a solution exists it will converge quite quickly. 
* You can change all hyperparameters in the define.h header file. 
* Currently the program outputs results only to the command line.
* This is the most up to date version of the program. 
* The code in this version has also been extensively commented, cleaned and translated to english.
##### This version doesn't support manual protein structure creation and simulation. You can run the searching algorithm by pressing the 'f' key. Otherwise check the user guide in section 3.7 of the [paper](https://ricsinaruto.github.io/website/docs/tdk.pdf), and you can find instructions on how to enter a logic function in section 3.5.2.
