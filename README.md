# simulated-annealing
##### For this variant of the program I implemented a simulated annealing based searching algorithm to find field values to apply to a user defined protein structure in order to achieve a user defined logic function. This means that before running the program the protein structure has to be defined in the fofuggveny function in interaction.cpp, since the simulated annealing algorithm only optimizes the field values applied to the proteins.
##### In this version of the program manual simulation of protein structures is not supported. The searching algorithm can be run by pressing the 'f' key. Otherwise check the user guide in section 3.7 of the [paper](https://ricsinaruto.github.io/website/docs/tdk.pdf), and you can find instructions on how to enter a logic function in section 3.5.2.
