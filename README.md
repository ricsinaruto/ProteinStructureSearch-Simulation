# Early-searching-algorithm branch
##### Here you can find the original version of the program, as described in the [paper](https://ricsinaruto.github.io/website/docs/tdk.pdf). A very simple searching algorithm is used to find good protein structures. Basically it looks through all the possible protein structures and field value configurations until it finds one that satisfies the user defined logic function. All the functionality is described in the paper and a user guide is provided in section 3.7. For instructions on how to create a protein structure and simulate it check section 3.4.3, and for creating a logic function check section 3.5.2.
